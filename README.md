# Introduction
This project was initially created in 2019 as a very basic vanilla JS site. 
In August 2020, it was re-developed as a React/Redux site to increase the site speed and user-friendliness.
The project retrieves data from a JSON file and parses it to present different stories in a uniform manner.
